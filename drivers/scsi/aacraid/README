AACRAID Driver for Linux (take two)

Introduction
-------------------------
The aacraid driver adds support for Adaptec (http://www.adaptec.com)
OEM based RAID controllers. This is a major rewrite from the original 
Adaptec supplied driver. It has signficantly cleaned up both the code
and the running binary size (the module is less than half the size of
the original).

This driver is experimental.

Supported Cards/Chipsets
-------------------------
	Dell Computer Corporation PERC 2 Quad Channel
	Dell Computer Corporation PERC 2/Si
	Dell Computer Corporation PERC 3/Si
	Dell Computer Corporation PERC 3/Di
	HP NetRAID-4M

Probably Supported Devices
-------------------------
	Any and All Adaptec branded AAC964/5400 series raid controllers.

None currently. Also note this is very different to Brian's original driver
so don't expect him to support it.
