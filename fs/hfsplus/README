HFS+ is the standard volume format for Mac OS X.

A basic overview and also a detailed description of the HFS+ volume format
is provided by Apple's technical note 1150.

The new driver provides full access to HFS+ plus volumes under Linux. It
bases on the driver by Brad Boyer at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-hfsplus.

This driver now supports full read and write access and has a better
perfomance. It also supports hard links and the resource fork is accessible
via /rsrc.

This is a beta release, it was intensively tested, but use at your own risk.
