ChangeLog for smbfs.

2001-05-24 Urban Widmark <urban@teststation.com>

	  with different modes (O_RDONLY -> O_WRONLY) without closing.
	  (bugfix from 2.4.3, fix by Michael Kockelkorn)
	* inode.c: tail -f fix for non-readonly opened files
	  (related to the smb_proc_open change).
	  (bugfix from 2.4.3)
	* inode.c: tail -f fix for fast size changes with the same mtime.
	  (bugfix from 2.4.3)

2000-11-22 Igor Zhbanov <bsg@uniyar.ac.ru>

	  and date_dos2unix for date==0

2000-11-04 Urban Widmark <urban@svenskatest.se>

	* proc.c, sock.c: adjust max parameters & max data to follow max_xmit

	  problem/race.
	* proc.c: O_RDONLY & smb_revalidate_inode fix (tail -f)
	* proc.c: add nls support
	* sock.c: attempt to fix smb_data_callback (avoid infinite loop)

2000-06-24: Matt Maynard <matthewm@corel.com>

	* dir.c: dentry->d_inode->i_mtime isn't updated for all servers
	  (NT?) and all operations (mv oldfile.txt newfile.txt) Removed for
	  less efficient but better working directory cache.
	* proc.c: included aDIR smbclient fix for renaming directories on
	  OS/2 servers (win95/98?) (orig by John Janosik)

	* *.c: replace ugly #ifdef's with less ugly debug macros.

2000-03-?? Andrew Tridgell

	* proc.c: added posix semantics for unlink

1999-11-16 Andrew Tridgell

[there are a few missing here :) ]

You are in the wrong end for adding new entries. New entries at the top.
