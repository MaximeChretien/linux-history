This is a basic TODO list for the Philips Nino porting effort. Things
will be added and removed from time to time. Pick an item and help
me out! Thanks!

- COMPACTFLASH
  * get IDE/PCMCIA chip interface working to read flash cards and the
    ethernet card
- FRAMEBUFFER
  * complete rewrite to match new framebuffer API
  * get 2bpp and 4bpp working (use Microwindows driver examples)
- GPIO
  * go through all the interrupt sources in status registers 1-5
    and see what all the different IO pins are hooked to
- KGDB
  * get stub working
- MMU
  * Use CONFIG_CPU_TX39XX instead of current CONFIG_CPU_R3000 and
    start using 3912 specific MMU management.
