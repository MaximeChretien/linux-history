 *      Hit_Invalidate_D and Create_Dirty_Excl_D should only be
 *      executed if there is no other dcache activity. If the dcache is
 *      accessed for another instruction immeidately preceding when these
 *      cache instructions are executing, it is possible that the dcache
 *      tag match outputs used by these cache instructions will be
 *      incorrect. These cache instructions should be preceded by at least
 *      four instructions that are not any kind of load or store
 *      instruction.
